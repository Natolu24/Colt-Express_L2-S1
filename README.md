# Colt-Express_L2-S1
Colt Express game made in Python with Tkinter on a group of 2

In a class where we needed to make an interface with Tkinter, we were asked to make a simplified version of the "Colt Express" board game.
We found the video game adaptation of the board game and took inspiration from it, as well as the assets.
And then tried to remake the full game, but it was kinda a big project and I didn't really had a smooth exprerience with Tkinter.
I also didn't really paid attention to Python garbage collection, and so I end up doing a **really not optimised** game haha...
While trying to make a working resizable game window, it end up refreshing every assets on screen instead on saving them, and also at each action made, so it made a not really enjoyable laggy gameplay.
Still was interesting, even tho with fixing almost constant assets loading issue, that would have saved me a lots of time, especially on debugging, and that way I would have maybe made a fully fonctional game that way (half of the game debugged, and not playable in it's entirety)
